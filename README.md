# Image-Based Lighting Examples + Utilities

This is a version of the 15-466 base code (base3, in fact) with some example image-based lighting code.

See the ```cubes/``` directory for processing code and the ```rgbe.hpp``` function for conversion between RGBE8 and floating point color data.
See ```ShowCubeMode.cpp``` for the example cubemap loading, setup, and rendering code, and ```cube_*_program.*pp``` for the shaders themselves.
